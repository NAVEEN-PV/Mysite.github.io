    			<div>
    				As important as it is to protect mature trees, it’s also essential to think ahead and plant new trees that will eventually get tall enough to contribute to the canopy, clean the air and help keep temperatures cool. Many towns and cities have organizations like Portland, Oregon’s Friends of Trees[5] working to plant trees in areas that have too few. If your town or city doesn’t have a similar organization, why not start one yourself? Tree by tree, you can make a difference. • The type of tree you plant matters. Talk with an arborist about which species are native to your area and will eventually get big enough to clean the air and water. Small, ornamental trees won’t contribute much. • Buying trees can get expensive. See if there’s a nursery nearby that shares your views on trees and could give your group a discount on baby trees.
